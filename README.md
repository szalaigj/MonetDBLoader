# MonetDBLoader
Batch Loader utility for MonetDB database

This toolkit is useful when the following requirements are needed:

Large-sized source files is needed to be loaded to tables of MonetDB (https://www.monetdb.org/) and it is possibly these files are transformed because of target format (schema of target table). Fullfilment of this purpose requires to create bulk load files and contents of these files are inserted to load tables. At present, the toolkit is proposed to load sequences of reference genome but possible extension is opened for loading of additional file formats easily.

The work is supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund: OTKA-114560.
